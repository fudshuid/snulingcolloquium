### Abstract: 
<br/>
We discuss a puzzling phenomenon dubbed illusory inferences from disjunction, which has been thoroughly studied in the psychological study of reasoning. In the first part of the seminar, we will demonstrate how linguistic study on disjunction and formal pragmatics shed light on this reasoning problem. In the second part of the seminar, we will present a variety of different studies in experimental linguistics that may benefit from extant work on reasoning. First, we introduce studies employing the novel methodology of using reasoning tasks to gain deeper understanding of existential construction in the modal and nominal domain. Second, we introduce studies using pragmatic priming and exclusively visual stimuli to test the role of attention versus pragmatics in the arising of fallacious conclusions.
