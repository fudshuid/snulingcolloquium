### Abstract:

<br/>
One of the fundamental questions in the neurobiology of language is how our brain composes a complex meaning out of simpler building blocks. With non-invasive neuroimaging methods at our disposal, the understanding of the neural underpinnings of semantic composition has been greatly expanded in the last decade, with overall results pointing to the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) as a locus of basic combinatorial semantics. Most of these results, however, have focused on the composition of object concepts (i.e., noun phrases), leaving the event concept composition relatively less understood.
<br/><br/>
In this talk, I briefly review recent findings on the neural correlates of semantic composition, mainly focusing on evidence from MEG (Magnetoencephalography). Then I present two MEG studies exploring the neural correlates of semantic composition in the event domain. The first study will demonstrate the engagement of the LATL in adverb-verb composition, with its overall pattern being parallel to what has been observed in the adjectival modification. The second study continues to explore the nature of semantic composition happening in the LATL, by taking a deeper look into the adverbial modification in an extended environment, i.e., a sentence. In sum, this talk will portray a more detailed picture of how event concept composition recruits the brain, especially the LATL.
