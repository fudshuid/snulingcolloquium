### Abstract:

<br/>
According to the classical description of obviation, the subject of a subjunctive is disjoint in reference from the attitude-holder subject of the immediately higher clause.

```
 *  Je    veux     que      je     parte.

    I     want     that     I      leave-subj

    `I want for me to leaveâ€™
```

Inspired by Ruwet (1984/1991) and Farkas (1988, 1992), I present data from Hungarian where obviation in certain subjunctives is plainly lifted, and data where obviation occurs in indicatives. I argue that obviation is not the result of competition with another construction, and point to promising accounts in terms of a clash in semantics or pragmatics.
