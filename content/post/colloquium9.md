### Abstract:

<br/>
An utterance is split into two components, the propositional component and the expressive component. The propositional component, which is in the C-system, contains all the elements that contribute to the proposition and its truth-value. The expressive component is dedicated to the performance of speech acts. In this talk, I will explore the syntax of the expressive component. Extending the work of Krifka (2014, 2015, 2019, 2020), I will propose that the expressive component consists of the Speaker-Hearer Phrase at the top, followed by the Commitment Phrase, which in turn selects the C-system. I will give evidence for this structure by drawing data from a variety of languages, especially Basque, Japanese, and Romanian, with reference also to the language of autistic children. This talk is based on the manuscript, "Syntax in the Treetops" (Miyagawa, 2020).
