3. **Past Tense Morphology and the Choice of Connectives in Korean Counterfactual Conditionals: An Experimental Approach** by Jiyeong Kim (SNU)

Abstract:

> Counterfactual conditionals convey the speaker's belief that the proposition in the antecedent is contrary to fact. As Iatridou (2000) claimed, past tense morphology is the hallmark of subjunctive conditionals cross-linguistically, which is also the case for Korean (Han,2006). Besides, Korean has two types of conditional connectives, -myen and –tamyen. The connective –tamyen has been related with the speaker’s hypothetical or irrealis attitude while –myen is a conditional connective in any type of attitude. However, some debates have arisen regarding the hypothetical property of -tamyen since it is freely interchangeable with –myen and it can also be used in a situation where the antecedent clause is quoting another’s utterance. This paper examined how past tense morphology and two different types of connectives in Korean conditionals contribute to counterfactual interpretation using an experimental method.

> Forty Korean native speakers participated in a truth judgement rating (7-point Likert scale). A conditional sentence, differing in two levels (Past vs. Non-past, -myen vs. –tamyen in antecedent) was first presented to the participants as a context. The participants then judged the following sentence indicating realization or non-realization of consequence in the prior conditional. If the antecedent of a conditional sentence is interpreted as having a strong counterfactual meaning, realization of a consequent will be more likely to be judged as false l while the unrealized condition will be true.

> The results show that counterfactual meaning in Korean conditionals is affected not only by the use of past tense morphology but also by the choice of connectives. Significantly lower truth rating was observed in the realized consequent condition when past tense was marked in the antecedent. Furthermore, counterfactual interpretation was reinforced with –tamyen when past tense appeared.

3. **How tight is the link between alternations and phonotactics?** by Jongho Jun (SNU), Hanyoung Byun (SNU), Seon Park (SNU) & Yoona Yee (SNU)

Abstract:

> It has been argued that some phonological alternations apply to abide by phonotactic restrictions, whereas alternation processes with morphologically derived environment effects (MDEE) exhibit a mismatch with phonotactics. However, as phonotactic well-formedness can be gradient rather than categorical, there might be cases in which lexically attested sequences which undergo an alternation across morphemes are not entirely phonotactically well-formed.

> To explore the link between alternations and phonotactics in detail, we focus on three processes in Korean which may apply only in derived environments: palatalization, vowel harmony and compound tensing. In order to find out the extent to which these processes are supported by their corresponding phonotactics, we conduct a human behavioral experiment by collecting Korean speakers’ non-word acceptability judgements. Furthermore, we conduct a computational modelling of Korean speakers’ phonotactic grammar to examine whether the non-word acceptability judgements can be projected from the Korean lexicon.

> Our primary results show that not all alternation processes match well with the relevant phonotactics. However, acceptability ratings by Korean speakers show a high correlation with the predicted ratings from the learned grammar, if the lexicon employed consists of both native and Sino-Korean words. This suggests that Korean speakers’ phonotactic knowledge is indeed projected from the lexicon.
